## Data API for [KonSchool](https://github.com/maacpiash/KonSchool) app

The database is hosted on mLab. Since I could not connect to the database directly in my ASP.NET Core app, I had to introduce this detour!

### Usage
- To get the details of all the schools: https://konschool-mlab-host.herokuapp.com/api/schools
- To get the details of one school with EIIN number xyz: https://konschool-mlab-host.herokuapp.com/api/schools/xyz

### Acknowledgement
Data on secondary schools in Bangladesh was collected from [Bangladesh Open Data](http://data.gov.bd).
